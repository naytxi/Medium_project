🖐️ Hi! I'm Nay and I'm currently learning to code.

<h2> 🚀ABOUT </h2>

**Objective:**

This project is designed to build on basic HTML knowledge by following the instructor in real-time as they introduce more advanced HTML elements.
The goal is for students to expand their understanding of HTML structure and learn how to use new tags and effectively.

**Instructions:**

    Follow the Instructor’s Demonstration:
    Watch and code along as the instructor demonstrates various intermediate HTML elements and attributes. Each student will create their own webpage with these new elements, matching the instructor’s examples.

    Practice New HTML Elements:
    The instructor will introduce elements such as tables, iframes, semantic tags (like <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>), and more complex link structures. Students will use these elements to structure and organize content on the page.

    Ask Questions and Collaborate:
    This project encourages active participation. Students should ask questions whenever necessary and work collaboratively to help each other understand the new elements and attributes being introduced.

✈️ Welcome to my journey.
